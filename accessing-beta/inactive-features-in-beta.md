### Credit Cards Processing

The Beta system is interacting with a test environment for credit card processing.  The has a couple of implications

1. **Valid Credit Cards will fail** - The test environment will only accept test cards and transactiuons that are attempted with a valid card will fail by design.
2. **Gateways -** Your credit card gateways that you normally use will not be present.  All customers will have a single test gateway to use for testing credit card charges.
3. **Testing Cards -**We will be providing testing credit card numbers you can use if you wish to test these transactions.
