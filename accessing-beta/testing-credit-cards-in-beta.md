## Test Environment

We have setup a testing environment that will allow you to test credit card charging features without actually running the risk of charging a card in this test enviroment.

### Test Gateway

All customers will be using a testing gateway titled "xyz"

### Testing Credit Cards

In the Beta testing system, production credit cards cannot be used for testing. Below is a list of cards that you can use for testing.  The following link will show the available test cards to use.&#x20;

There is a column for good cards that will work. There is also a column for cards that should not work. Users can test the main types of credit cards, which include Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover.&#x20;
