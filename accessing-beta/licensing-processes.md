# Licensing Processes



## Creating a New Show

Creating a new show record in the beta environment is still similar to the process in 4D; however, there are some minor changes that we will discuss here.&#x20;

Now, in the beta environment, there are three types of licenses that users can choose to use. These include Template Show, Demo Show, and Regular License.&#x20;

### Template Show

A template show only allows the creation of a show record. No entries are allowed to be entered into any shows created using this license.&#x20;

This type of license is used to test the basis of creating a new show.&#x20;

### Demo Show

This type of show license allows up to 25 entries to be added into the show.&#x20;

With this type of license, you can test the basis of building a show and inputting entries.

### Regular License

This license allows as many entries added into the show as the user wants.&#x20;

To use this license, the user must have an asset code and passcode. These can be obtained by contacting the support team and requesting a code for the show.&#x20;

When requesting the asset code, we will also need the number of entries that the user does want to create the show for.&#x20;



## Show Information

When creating a license, the basic information of the show is needed for all three licenses. This information required is the show name and the show dates.&#x20;

Only the Regular License requires an asset code and passcode. Those input sections will be editable when the Regular License is chosen from the Select License dropbox.&#x20;
