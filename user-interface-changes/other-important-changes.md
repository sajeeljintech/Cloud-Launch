# Other Important Changes

## Class Max Size Rule - Eliminated

There has been a class rule for setting the maximum size of a class.  This rule however relied on a field in the class for the max size NOT the value in the rule.

We have modified this logic and simply base class maximum size on the field in the class.  The rule for max size is no longer needed or relevant.
