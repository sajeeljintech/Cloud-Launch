  There are several "shortcuts" that users can utilize in the list view of a
  module. In the example below, the Entries Module is referenced, however, these
  features can be used in any module.

# List View Guide

## Differences & Similarities

We have tried to keep as many shortcuts the same as they were in the existing system, for the most part we were able to achieve that.  There are a couple of cases where we were not able to maintain the existing key strokes.

1. New Record - This has traditionally been CMD/Control + N - However that keystroke has the meaning in all browsers of creating a new window in the browser.  We have changed this to Command - B

## Shortcut Commands

### Summary of Commands

<table><thead><tr><th width="165">Windows (Control)</th><th width="188">Mac (Command)</th><th>Action</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ctrl + U</td><td>Cmd + U</td><td>Show Subset</td></tr><tr><td>Ctrl + G</td><td>Cmd + G</td><td>Show All</td></tr><tr><td>Ctrl + P</td><td>Cmd + P</td><td>Print Results</td></tr><tr><td>Ctrl + A</td><td>Cmd + A</td><td>Select All </td></tr><tr><td>Ctrl + B</td><td>Cmd + B</td><td>New Record</td></tr><tr><td>Ctrl + F</td><td>Cmd + F</td><td>Open Advance Search</td></tr><tr><td>Arrow Up/Down</td><td>Arrow Up/Down</td><td>Scroll Through List Results</td></tr><tr><td>ENTER</td><td>ENTER</td><td>Open Record</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Show Subset: "Cmd + U"/ "Ctrl + U" (Mac/Windows)

When using this shortcut option, the user will need to highlight a selection of records that they want to see separate from the entire list.&#x20;

Once the user has this selection of records, using the "Cmd + U"/ "Ctrl + U" option will show only those selected records in the list.&#x20;

### Show All Results: "Cmd + G"/ "Ctrl + G" (Mac/Windows)

When a user has created a subset of records in a list view and wants to go back to the full list view of records, the shortcut to do this is by using "Cmd + G"/ "Ctrl + G".&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This will change the view from the subset selection to all records.&#x20;

### Print Results: "Cmd + P"/ "Ctrl + P" (Mac/Windows)

Using the shortcut "Cmd + P"/ "Ctrl + P" will bring up the Printable Reports for that specific module.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (27).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The user can then choose the specific report that is needed and print.&#x20;



### Select All Results: "Cmd + A"/ "Ctrl + A" (Mac/Windows)

If a user needs to select all of the items from the list view, this can be acheived by highlighting a record and hitting "Cmd + A"/ "Ctrl + A".&#x20;

Using this shortcut will highlight all of the records in the list view.&#x20;

### New Record: "Cmd + B"/ "Ctrl + B" (Mac/Windows)

The shortcut "Cmd + B"/ "Ctrl + B" can be used to create a new record in the module the user is working out of.&#x20;

When using the shortcut, the system will open the input form to add a new record.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (29).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The user can then input the information needed for the new record and save.

### Open Advanced Search Dialog: "Cmd + F"/ "Ctrl + F" (Mac/Windows)

When a user needs to use the advanced search in a module, opening that search form can be completed by using the shortcut "Cmd + F"/ "Ctrl + F".&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (30).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The user can then enter the specifics for the records that are being looked for and run the search.&#x20;

### Navigate Results: ArrowUp and ArrowDown

Navigating records through the list can be completed by using the arrow up and down. \
This will allow the user to move through records one item at a time.&#x20;

### Open Record: ENTER

Opening a record with a shortcut can be completed by using the enter button. Highlighting the record and then choosing enter will open that individual record.&#x20;

## Right Clicking List View

In the list view, users may right click a selected line item(s) to reveal several options. The entries module is used as an example below.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (35).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Edit:** the "edit" feature will open the record detail view to allow editing.

**Open in new tab:** the "open in new tab" feature will open the record in a new tab.

**Omit Subset:** the "omit subset" feature will omit the selection from the subset.

**Show Subset:** the "show subset" feature will show the selected records as a subset

**Show All:** the "show all" feature will show all records in the module

**Save Selection:** the "save selection" feature will save the selected record(s) as a selection.

**Use Saved Selection:** the "use saved selection" feature will show the saved selection.

**Print:** the "print" feature will show the available reports for the selected record in the given module.

## Column Actions

There are several new features on the list view that will allow the user to customize and organize the view as they wish.

### Drag and Drop

Users may "drag and drop" columns to reorder them. For example, to move the "entry" column, the user should click on the header as seen below, "drag" the column to the desired area and "drop" (release the click/hold) into place. Below the entry column has been moved inbetween the Owner and Stable columns.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (48).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Drag and drop into place</p></figcaption></figure>

### Sorting

Users are now able to sort individual columns numerically or alphabetically. Clicking on the column header will sort records in that column. An up or down arrow will appear next to the header to indicate that records are sorted in ascending or descending order in that particular column.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (49).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The up arrow indicates records are being sorted based off of the horse column in ascending alphabetical order.</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (50).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The down arrow indicates records are being sorted based off of the horse column in descending alphabetical order.</p></figcaption></figure>

### Showing and Hiding

Users are now able to show and hide particular columns. The user should hover over any column header until the highlighted icon below appears.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (52).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once the icon is clicked, the menu below will appear. To show a column, check the box next to the column name. To hide, uncheck the box.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (53).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Here the stable box is checked and the stable column is visible.</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (54).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Here the stable box is unchecked and the stable column is NOT visible.</p></figcaption></figure>
